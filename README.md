# YELP-CAMP
YelpCamp is a more complex application built from scratch using the following technologies:  On the front-end I have used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap for responsive layout, and jQuery. On the back-end I used NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST, Authentication, Authorization and PassportJS. For datastore I used non-sql MongoDB. The application was developed on Cloud9 IDE and source versioned with GIT. The application is hosted on Heroku servers and MongoLab. Yelp Camp is a fun application that allows you to view campgrounds with a short description. Once you login or signup you can begin to create your own campgrounds that includes a title, image address and short description. You will also be able to leave a comment or edit a campground of yours.
